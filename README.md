> Decentralized peer-to-peer rental platform built on the [Stellar](https://stellar.org) blockchain.

Rentars is an evolution of [StellarRent](https://github.com/Stellar-Rent/stellar-rent), rebranded and substantially extended. The mission is the same: eliminate rental intermediaries (Airbnb, agencies) through Stellar's fast transactions (~3–5 s), near-zero fees (~$0.000001), and Soroban smart contracts for trustless escrow — but the platform is now a fully featured system, not a scaffold.

---

## Why Rentars?

Traditional rental platforms charge 7–20 % in fees, take 1–7 days to process payments, and exclude small property owners in emerging markets. Rentars addresses this with:

- **Minimal fees** — Stellar's near-zero transaction costs passed directly to users
- **Instant USDC payments** — Payments settle in seconds, not days
- **Trustless escrow** — Soroban smart contracts hold funds until rental conditions are met
- **Full transparency** — Every transaction recorded on Stellar's public ledger
- **No middlemen** — Direct owner-to-tenant relationships

---

## Implemented features

The following are implemented and tested in the current codebase.
"Production-certified" means the feature has automated tests and runs in the CI pipeline.
It does not imply mainnet deployment, which requires the additional steps in [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Backend (Node.js / Bun / Express)

### Smart Contracts (Rust / Soroban)

| Contract | Status |
|---|---|
| Property listing contract | ✅ Implemented |
| Booking contract (with escrow lifecycle) | ✅ Implemented |

### Known limitations

- Mainnet deployment has not been performed. The system targets Stellar testnet.
- Smart contracts have not undergone a third-party security audit.
- Geocoding (latitude/longitude import) requires a configured `GEOCODING_API_KEY`.
- PostGIS must be enabled on the Supabase project before geolocation search works.
- The Stellar CLI and Rust toolchain are required only to build / redeploy contracts, not to run the application.

## Getting started

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rentars/Rentars.git
cd Rentars
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
# Backend
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
# Required: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, JWT_SECRET, REDIS_URL,
#           STELLAR_RPC_URL, PROPERTY_LISTING_CONTRACT_ID, BOOKING_CONTRACT_ID,
#           REVIEW_CONTRACT_ID, TRUSTLESS_WORK_API_URL, TRUSTLESS_WORK_API_KEY

# Frontend
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
# Required: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK,
#           NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL
```

See `apps/backend/.env.example` and `apps/web/.env.example` for the full list of variables.

### 3. Run the development stack

Option A — individual services:

```bash
# Terminal 1: backend (port 3000)
cd apps/backend
bun run dev

# Terminal 2: frontend (port 3001)
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

Option B — full Docker stack (frontend + backend + Redis):

```bash
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
docker compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3001 |
| Backend API | http://localhost:3000 |
| API health | http://localhost:3000/health |
| Redis | redis://localhost:6379 |

### 4. Apply database migrations

The backend database schema is managed with SQL migration files under
`apps/backend/database/migrations/`. Apply them to your Supabase project via the
Supabase SQL editor or using `psql`:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d rentars -f apps/backend/database/setup.sql
```

See [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) for the complete migration procedure.

---

## Running tests

### Backend

```bash
cd apps/backend

# All tests
bun test

# Unit tests only
bun test tests/unit

# Integration tests
bun test tests/integration

# RLS policy tests
bun test tests/rls
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd apps/web

# Unit and component tests (Vitest)
npm test

# End-to-end tests (Playwright — requires a running dev server)
npm run e2e

# Visual regression baselines — capture new snapshots
npx playwright test e2e/visual-regression.spec.ts --update-snapshots
```
