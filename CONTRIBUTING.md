## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Rentars.git
   cd Rentars
   ```

3. Install all workspace dependencies from the repo root:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   > **Note:** The project uses **Yarn 1 (Classic)** workspaces. Do not use `npm install` or `bun install`
   > at the root — they will ignore the workspace layout.

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Required version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | ≥ 20 | Frontend build & root scripts |
| [Bun](https://bun.sh) | ≥ 1.0 | Backend runtime & test runner |
| Yarn | ≥ 1.22 | Workspace package manager |
| Rust + Cargo | stable | Soroban smart contracts |
| `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target | — | Contract WASM compilation |
| [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/stellar-cli) | latest | Contract deployment |
| [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project | — | Database + Auth |

Install the Rust WASM target:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

---

## Development Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd apps/backend
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, JWT_SECRET (min 32 chars),
# STELLAR_NETWORK, TRUSTLESS_WORK_API_URL, TRUSTLESS_WORK_API_KEY
bun run dev        # starts with --watch on port 3000
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd apps/web
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
yarn dev           # starts Next.js on port 3001 (or next available port)
```

### Both at once (from repo root)

```bash
yarn dev
# Runs backend (blue) and frontend (green) concurrently via `concurrently`
```

### Full stack with Docker

```bash
# Copy env files first
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local

# Start all services (backend, frontend, Redis)
docker-compose up --build

# Development mode with hot-reload volumes
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up
```

| Service | URL | Port |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3001 | 3001 |
| Backend API | http://localhost:3000 | 3000 |
| Redis | redis://localhost:6379 | 6379 |

---

## Database

### Apply migrations

Migrations live in `apps/backend/database/migrations/`. They are SQL files with a
`NNNNN_description.sql` naming convention. Apply them via the Supabase dashboard or CLI:

```bash
supabase db reset    # applies all migrations to the local Supabase stack
```

### Naming new migrations

New migration files **must** use the next sequential five-digit prefix. Check the highest
existing prefix before adding a file. Duplicate prefixes fail the `validate:migrations` CI job:

```bash
yarn workspace rentars-backend validate:migrations
```

### Seed data

```bash
yarn workspace rentars-backend db:seed
```

---

## Smart Contracts (Rust / Soroban)

```bash
cd apps/contracts

# Build all contracts to WASM
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Run contract unit tests (pure Rust, no Stellar network needed)
cargo test

# Deploy to Stellar Testnet (requires Stellar CLI + funded testnet account)
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/rental_contract.wasm \
  --network testnet \
  --source <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
```

---

## Code Quality

Rentars uses **Biome** for both linting and formatting (replaces ESLint + Prettier).

```bash
# Check everything (run before pushing)
yarn lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues and reformat
yarn lint:fix

# Format only (no lint)
yarn format
```

The `biome.json` at the repo root configures 2-space indentation, single quotes, and
trailing commas. Run `yarn lint` in CI to catch regressions.

### Pre-commit hook

A `.husky/pre-commit` hook exists, but `husky` and `lint-staged` are **not currently
installed** as root dependencies, so the hook is inert on a clean checkout. Always run
lint and format yourself before pushing:

```bash
yarn lint
yarn format
```

If you re-enable the hook, install the missing tooling first:

```bash
yarn add -D husky lint-staged
```

---

## Testing

### Backend

The backend uses **Bun's built-in test runner**. Test files live under
`apps/backend/src/__tests__/` (unit) and `apps/backend/tests/` (integration/e2e/RLS).

```bash
# Run all backend tests
yarn workspace rentars-backend test

# Unit tests only (fast, no network/DB required)
yarn workspace rentars-backend test:unit

# Integration / E2E tests (mocked Supabase + TrustlessWork)
yarn workspace rentars-backend test:integration

# Booking E2E lifecycle test
yarn workspace rentars-backend test:e2e

# RLS policy tests (requires a running local Supabase stack)
yarn workspace rentars-backend test:rls

# Shell-based API smoke tests (requires a running backend on port 3000)
yarn workspace rentars-backend test:api

# Generate lcov coverage report
yarn workspace rentars-backend test:coverage
```

> **Watch mode:** Bun's test runner does not have a `--watch` flag that works identically to
> Vitest. Use `bun run --watch src/index.ts` for the dev server instead.

### Frontend

The frontend uses **Vitest** for unit/component tests and **Playwright** for E2E.

```bash
# Single run (CI-safe, no watch mode)
yarn workspace web test --run

# Watch mode (local development)
yarn workspace web test:watch

# Coverage
yarn workspace web test:coverage

# Playwright E2E (requires a built Next.js app)
yarn workspace web e2e

# Specific E2E suite
yarn workspace web e2e:journey
```

### CI jobs (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

| Job | What it does |
|---|---|
| `runtime-check` | Verifies Node/Bun/Yarn versions via `scripts/check-engines.sh` |
| `release-validation` | Validates `CHANGELOG.md` via `yarn release:validate` |
| `validate-migrations` | Checks migration filenames for duplicate/out-of-order prefixes |
| `unit-tests` | Backend unit tests via Bun (no external services) |
| `backend-e2e` | Full booking lifecycle with mocked Supabase + TrustlessWork |
| `rls-tests` | Row-level security policies against a local Supabase Postgres |
| `contracts` | Builds and tests the Soroban contracts |
| `frontend-checks` | Frontend lint and unit tests |
| `frontend-e2e` | Playwright search → booking journey on Chromium |
| `docs-link-check` | Fails on broken internal documentation links |

All jobs run on every push or PR to `main`, `master`, or `develop`.

### Lockfile note

Use **Yarn 1** so `yarn.lock` is the canonical lockfile. If a clean checkout only has
`package-lock.json`, run `yarn install` once to regenerate `yarn.lock`, then commit it.
Do not commit `npm install` output.

---

## Branching & Pull Requests

- Branch from `main` and open PRs back to `main`.
- Branch naming convention: `feat/short-description`, `fix/short-description`, `docs/…`, `chore/…`
- Keep PR titles under 70 characters. Use the description for context.
- Include a **testing evidence** section in the PR body (which test commands you ran).
- At least one review is required before merging.
- Squash-merge to keep the commit history clean.

---

## Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add property wishlisting
fix: resolve booking conflict on same-day check-in
docs: update contributing commands
refactor: extract refund policy into service
test: add cancellation refund tier tests
chore: bump biome to 1.9.4
```

---

## Release Process

Releases are managed **manually** — there is no automated Changesets or npm-publish workflow.

1. Bump the version in the relevant `package.json` (root or workspace).
2. Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` following the existing format, then validate:

   ```bash
   yarn release:validate      # scripts/validate-changelog.ts
   yarn release:manifest      # scripts/generate-release-manifest.ts
   ```

   Both run in the `release-validation` CI job.
3. Open a PR titled `chore: release vX.Y.Z`.
4. After merge, create a GitHub Release and tag (`vX.Y.Z`).

> There is no `yarn changeset` command in this repository. Do not add changeset files.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `bun` not found

Bun is required to run backend scripts and tests. Install it:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Then restart your terminal and verify: `bun --version`.

### `rustup` / `cargo` not found

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### `yarn install` fails with peer-dependency errors

Use `--ignore-engines` as a last resort:

```bash
yarn install --ignore-engines
```

### Supabase local stack won't start

Supabase requires Docker. Make sure Docker Desktop is running, then:

```bash
supabase start
```

If you see port conflicts, check `supabase status` and stop other services on ports 54321/54322.

### Pre-commit hook fails with "lint-staged not found"

Run `yarn install` from the repo root to ensure all dev dependencies are installed, then try
committing again.

### Migration validation fails in CI

You added a migration with a duplicate prefix. Rename the file to use the next sequential
number (check the highest existing prefix in `apps/backend/database/migrations/`). See
`apps/backend/database/MIGRATIONS_NAMING.md` for the canonical ordering rules.

---

## Questions?

Open an issue for discussion before submitting a PR. Tag it `question` if you are unsure
whether something is a bug or intended behavior.
one negative test proving a zero or over-limit page size has explicit, bounded behavior, plus a regression test proving normal pages are untouched.

 `<angle_brackets>` must be replaced with real names from the contract. Where the contract doesn't answer a question, this spec says to flag it rather than invent a limit.

---

## 0. Scope and Rules

**In scope**
- One negative test for a single invalid page size (zero **or** over-limit).
- One regression test for a normal page size.
- Running the attestation pagination tests.

**Out of scope**
- Adding a new max constant or limit unless the contract interface already defines one.
- Changing the pagination signature.
- Refactoring storage or indexing.

**Hard rules**
1. Inspect before writing. The contract decides the expected behavior, not this document.
2. Use the contract's own constant for boundaries. Never hardcode a number the contract could change.
3. Assert either a stable error **or** documented clamping. Never assert "it doesn't crash."
4. If no bound exists today, stop and report it. That is a finding, not a test to fake.

---

## 1. Inspect the Current Contract

### 1.1 Find the pagination entrypoint

```bash
cd <repo-root>
grep -rn "fn list_\|fn get_.*attest\|fn .*page\|fn .*paginat\|fn query_" \
  contracts/attestation/src
```

Look for functions with a shape like:

```rust
pub fn list_attestations(
    env: Env,
    subject: Address,
    start: u32,      // offset or cursor
    limit: u32,      // THE size argument
) -> Vec<Attestation>
```

Record the answers:

| Question | Answer (fill in) |
|---|---|
| Function name | `<list_fn>` |
| Size arg name | `<limit \| page_size \| count>` |
| Size arg type | `<u32 \| u64>` |
| Start arg style | `<offset \| cursor \| page_number>` |
| Return type | `<Vec<T> \| Page<T>>` |
| Return includes next cursor? | `<yes/no>` |

### 1.2 Find any published maximum

```bash
grep -rn "MAX_\|max_page\|MAX_LIMIT\|PAGE_SIZE\|DEFAULT_LIMIT" \
  contracts/attestation/src
grep -rn -i "page size\|limit\|maximum\|pagination" \
  contracts/attestation/README.md docs/ 2>/dev/null
```

Check three places, since "published" can mean any of them:
- A `const` in the contract source.
- The doc comment on the function.
- The README, interface docs, or a generated spec.

| Item | Found? | Value | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| Max page size const | | | |
| Default page size const | | | |
| Documented in README/interface | | | |
| Doc comment on function | | | |

### 1.3 Find the current validation behavior

Read the function body and note what happens for each input:

```rust
// Pattern A: explicit error
if limit == 0 || limit > MAX_PAGE_SIZE {
    return Err(Error::InvalidPageSize);
}

// Pattern B: clamp
let limit = limit.min(MAX_PAGE_SIZE);

// Pattern C: clamp with zero default
let limit = if limit == 0 { DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE } else { limit.min(MAX_PAGE_SIZE) };

// Pattern D: panic
assert!(limit > 0 && limit <= MAX_PAGE_SIZE, "bad limit");

// Pattern E: nothing at all (unbounded)
for i in start..(start + limit) { ... }
```

Fill in the behavior table:

| Input | Current behavior | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `limit = 0` | | |
| `limit = MAX` | | |
| `limit = MAX + 1` | | |
| `limit = u32::MAX` | | |
| `start` beyond total | | |
| empty collection | | |

### 1.4 Check for existing tests

```bash
grep -rn "pagination\|limit\|page" contracts/attestation/src/test*.rs \
  contracts/attestation/tests 2>/dev/null
ls contracts/attestation/src | grep -i test
```

Note the test file location, the helper names (setup functions, fixtures), and whether a pagination test already exists. Extend that file. Don't create a parallel one.

### 1.5 Check the contract interface

If the project publishes an interface (spec JSON, TypeScript bindings, docs):

```bash
stellar contract bindings typescript --help   # if bindings are generated
grep -rn "list_\|limit" bindings/ 2>/dev/null
```

Rule: **a change that alters the published interface needs explicit sign-off.** A test alone should not touch it.

---

## 2. Decide Which Behavior to Test

Use this matrix after Section 1.

| Situation found | Test to write | Expected assertion |
|---|---|---|
| Error exists for over-limit | Over-limit test | Specific error variant |
| Error exists for zero only | Zero test | Specific error variant |
| Clamp exists, documented | Over-limit test | `len == MAX` |
| Clamp exists, undocumented | Report; test clamp only if the team confirms it as the contract | `len == MAX` |
| Panic on invalid | Over-limit test with `try_` call | Contract error / `Err` |
| **No bound at all** | **Do not write a passing test.** Flag it | Open a decision: error vs clamp |

### 2.1 Pick exactly ONE invalid case

The task says "one invalid size." Choose:

- **Max constant exists** → test `MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 1`.
- **Only a zero guard exists** → test `0`.
- **Both exist** → pick over-limit, since it directly proves the response is bounded.

### 2.2 If there is no bound

Write this up instead of a test:

```
FINDING: <list_fn> accepts any u32 for <limit>. With N attestations stored,
a request of u32::MAX attempts to return all N records in one call.
No published maximum exists in source, docs, or interface.

DECISION NEEDED (owner of contract interface):
  Option 1: reject with Error::InvalidPageSize for 0 or > MAX
  Option 2: clamp to MAX, document it
  
This task does not add a limit. Test deferred until the contract defines one.
```

That satisfies the acceptance criterion "no new limit is added without checking the contract interface."

---

## 3. Choose the Boundary Value

Boundaries come from the contract, not from guesses.

```rust
use crate::{MAX_PAGE_SIZE, Error};          // adjust paths
// or, if the const is private:
// use crate::constants::MAX_PAGE_SIZE;
```

| Case | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Zero | `0` | Degenerate size; often an off-by-one trap |
| Just over | `MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 1` | The tightest violation |
| Exactly at max | `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` | Must still succeed |
| Just under | `MAX_PAGE_SIZE - 1` | Must still succeed |
| Extreme | `u32::MAX` | Catches overflow and unbounded loops |

**Overflow caution:** if `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` could be `u32::MAX`, then `MAX + 1` wraps. Use `checked_add` or test `u32::MAX` directly:

```rust
let over = MAX_PAGE_SIZE.checked_add(1).expect("max is u32::MAX; use a different invalid case");
```

If the const is private and the test crate can't import it, ask whether it should be exposed to tests with `pub(crate)` or `#[cfg(test)]`. Don't copy the literal.

---

## 4. Test Harness

Reuse existing helpers if the test module has them. These are the minimum shapes needed.

### 4.1 Imports

```rust
#![cfg(test)]

use soroban_sdk::{testutils::Address as _, Address, Env, String, Vec};

use crate::{
    <ContractName>, <ContractName>Client, Error, MAX_PAGE_SIZE,
    // plus the Attestation type, if needed
};
```

### 4.2 Setup helper

```rust
struct Fixture<'a> {
    env: Env,
    client: <ContractName>Client<'a>,
    subject: Address,
    issuer: Address,
}

fn setup<'a>() -> Fixture<'a> {
    let env = Env::default();
    env.mock_all_auths();

    let contract_id = env.register(<ContractName>, ());
    let client = <ContractName>Client::new(&env, &contract_id);

    let admin = Address::generate(&env);
    let issuer = Address::generate(&env);
    let subject = Address::generate(&env);

    // Only if the contract needs init / issuer registration:
    // client.initialize(&admin);
    // client.register_issuer(&issuer);

    Fixture { env, client, subject, issuer }
}
```

### 4.3 Seeding helper

Seed a known number of records so assertions are exact.

```rust
fn seed(f: &Fixture, n: u32) {
    for i in 0..n {
        // Use the REAL attest/create function and signature.
        f.client.<attest_fn>(
            &f.issuer,
            &f.subject,
            &String::from_str(&f.env, &format!("claim-{}", i)),
            // ...other required args
        );
    }
}
```

Notes:
- `format!` isn't available in `no_std` contract code, but it **is** available in test code when the `std` feature is enabled for tests. If it isn't, build the string from a fixed set or use a counter-derived `BytesN`.
- Soroban test budgets are finite. If seeding `MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 10` records exhausts the budget, call `env.cost_estimate().budget().reset_unlimited()` in the test, and only there.

```rust
f.env.cost_estimate().budget().reset_unlimited();
```

### 4.4 Large-seed guard

```rust
// Seeding cost scales with MAX_PAGE_SIZE. If MAX is large (e.g. 1000),
// keep the dataset to MAX + small margin, not far above.
const SEED_MARGIN: u32 = 5;
```

---

## 5. The Negative Test

Write **one** of 5A or 5B, depending on Section 2.

### 5A. Contract returns a stable error

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_rejects_over_limit_page_size() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 5);

    let over_limit = MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 1;
    let res = f.client.try_<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &over_limit);

    // Stable error: assert the exact variant, not just is_err().
    assert_eq!(res, Err(Ok(Error::InvalidPageSize)));
}
```

**Why this shape**
- `try_` returns `Result<Result<T, ConversionError>, Result<Error, InvokeError>>`. The outer `Err(Ok(Error::X))` is a contract-defined error. Adjust the nesting if your SDK version differs.
- Asserting the exact variant makes the error part of the contract. A refactor that changes the variant fails the test.
- The seeded count (5) is deliberately small. The point is that the request is rejected regardless of how many records exist.

### 5A-zero. Zero variant

Use this instead if only zero is guarded:

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_rejects_zero_page_size() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 5);

    let res = f.client.try_<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &0u32);

    assert_eq!(res, Err(Ok(Error::InvalidPageSize)));
}
```

### 5B. Contract documents clamping

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_clamps_over_limit_page_size_to_max() {
    let f = setup();
    f.env.cost_estimate().budget().reset_unlimited();
    seed(&f, MAX_PAGE_SIZE + SEED_MARGIN);

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &(MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 1));

    // Bounded: exactly MAX, not total, not MAX+1.
    assert_eq!(page.len(), MAX_PAGE_SIZE);
}
```

### 5B-zero. Clamp-to-default variant

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_zero_page_size_uses_default() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE + SEED_MARGIN);

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &0u32);

    assert_eq!(page.len(), DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE);
}
```

### 5.1 What "stable" means

A stable error is:
- A named `contract_error` variant with a fixed numeric code.
- Not a string-matched panic message.
- Not dependent on dataset size.

Check the error enum:

```rust
#[contracterror]
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq, PartialOrd, Ord)]
#[repr(u32)]
pub enum Error {
    // ...
    InvalidPageSize = <n>,   // numeric value is part of the contract
}
```

If the contract panics with a string instead of returning an error, assert that in a `#[should_panic(expected = "...")]` test **only** if that panic is the documented behavior. Then note in the PR that a typed error would be more stable. Don't change it in this task.

---

## 6. The Regression Test (Normal Page Size)

This proves the validation didn't break the happy path.

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_normal_page_size_returns_expected_records() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 5);

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &3u32);

    assert_eq!(page.len(), 3);

    // Check content and order, not only the count.
    for i in 0..3u32 {
        let a = page.get(i).unwrap();
        assert_eq!(a.subject, f.subject);
        // assert_eq!(a.id, <expected_id_for_i>);
    }
}
```

### 6.1 Second page

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_second_page_continues_after_first() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 5);

    let p1 = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &3u32);
    let p2 = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &3u32, &3u32); // adjust for cursor style

    assert_eq!(p1.len(), 3);
    assert_eq!(p2.len(), 2);

    // No overlap between pages.
    for a in p1.iter() {
        for b in p2.iter() {
            assert_ne!(a.id, b.id);
        }
    }
}
```

If pagination is cursor-based, replace the second call with the cursor returned from the first page.

### 6.2 Exactly-at-max succeeds

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_exact_max_page_size_succeeds() {
    let f = setup();
    f.env.cost_estimate().budget().reset_unlimited();
    seed(&f, MAX_PAGE_SIZE + SEED_MARGIN);

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &MAX_PAGE_SIZE);

    assert_eq!(page.len(), MAX_PAGE_SIZE);
}
```

This guards against an off-by-one where the check is `>=` instead of `>`.

### 6.3 Page size larger than the dataset

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_page_size_above_total_but_under_max_returns_all() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 4);

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &10u32); // 10 <= MAX

    assert_eq!(page.len(), 4);
}
```

---

## 7. Optional Edge Tests

Add these only if cheap and only if the contract behavior is clear. The task asks for one invalid-size negative test, so keep extras in the regression category.

### 7.1 Empty collection

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_on_empty_set_returns_empty() {
    let f = setup();

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &5u32);

    assert_eq!(page.len(), 0);
}
```

### 7.2 Start beyond the end

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_start_beyond_total_returns_empty() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 3);

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &100u32, &5u32);

    assert_eq!(page.len(), 0);
}
```

Confirm the current behavior first. If the contract errors here, assert the error instead. Never assume.

### 7.3 Extreme value

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_u32_max_page_size_is_bounded() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 5);

    let res = f.client.try_<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &u32::MAX);

    // Error contract:
    assert_eq!(res, Err(Ok(Error::InvalidPageSize)));
    // Clamp contract: assert len <= MAX_PAGE_SIZE instead.
}
```

### 7.4 Start + limit overflow

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_start_plus_limit_does_not_overflow() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 3);

    // start near u32::MAX with a valid limit must not panic on addition.
    let res = f.client.try_<list_fn>(&f.subject, &(u32::MAX - 1), &5u32);

    assert!(res.is_ok()); // returns empty, never wraps into early indexes
    assert_eq!(res.unwrap().unwrap().len(), 0);
}
```

This catches `start + limit` wrapping into valid indexes, a real source of unbounded or wrong responses.

### 7.5 Other subjects unaffected

```rust
#[test]
fn pagination_only_returns_requested_subjects_records() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 3);
    let other = Address::generate(&f.env);
    // attest for `other` once
    f.client.<attest_fn>(&f.issuer, &other, &String::from_str(&f.env, "x"));

    let page = f.client.<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &10u32);

    assert_eq!(page.len(), 3);
}
```

## 8. Proving the Response Is Bounded

"Bounded" should be demonstrated, not inferred from `len`.

### 8.1 Length assertion (clamp contracts)

```rust
assert!(page.len() <= MAX_PAGE_SIZE);
```

### 8.2 Budget assertion

If the project tracks resource cost, compare the cost of a max-size page to an invalid request:

```rust
#[test]
fn invalid_page_size_is_rejected_cheaply() {
    let f = setup();
    seed(&f, 5);

    f.env.cost_estimate().budget().reset_default();
    let _ = f.client.try_<list_fn>(&f.subject, &0u32, &(MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 1));
    let cpu = f.env.cost_estimate().budget().cpu_instruction_cost();

    // Rejection should happen before iteration; keep the threshold loose.
    assert!(cpu < <GENEROUS_BOUND>);
}
```

Only include this if the repo already uses budget assertions. A new brittle numeric threshold isn't worth adding. If you include it, set the bound well above observed cost.

### 8.3 Validation order

Validation must happen **before** reading storage:

```rust
// good
if limit == 0 || limit > MAX_PAGE_SIZE { return Err(Error::InvalidPageSize); }
let items = read_storage(...);

// bad: reads everything, then trims
let items = read_storage(...);
if items.len() > MAX_PAGE_SIZE { ... }
```

Review the function body for this. If the order is wrong, report it. That's a contract fix outside this task.

## 9. Run the Tests

### 9.1 Targeted

```bash
cargo test -p <attestation-crate> pagination -- --nocapture
```

### 9.2 Full attestation suite

```bash
cargo test -p <attestation-crate>
```

### 9.3 Workspace sanity

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy -p <attestation-crate> --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

### 9.4 Confirm the test actually tests something

Mutation check, done locally and not committed:

1. In the contract, temporarily change `limit > MAX_PAGE_SIZE` to `limit > MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 1`.
2. Run the negative test.
3. It must **fail**.
4. Revert the change.

If it still passes, the boundary value isn't hitting the guard. Fix the test.

Repeat for the zero guard (`limit == 0` → `limit == 1`) if you wrote the zero test.

### 9.5 Expected output

```
running 4 tests
test tests::pagination_rejects_over_limit_page_size ... ok
test tests::pagination_normal_page_size_returns_expected_records ... ok
test tests::pagination_exact_max_page_size_succeeds ... ok
test tests::pagination_second_page_continues_after_first ... ok

test result: ok. 4 passed; 0 failed
```

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` not found | Private const | Ask to expose with `pub(crate)`; don't hardcode |
| `try_` result shape mismatch | SDK version | Match against the existing tests' `try_` handling |
| Budget exceeded while seeding | Large `MAX` | `budget().reset_unlimited()` inside the test only |
| Negative test passes before any guard exists | Contract panics generically | Inspect the failure; assert the real error or report the gap |
| Negative test passes with the guard mutated | Wrong boundary value | Use `MAX + 1`, not an arbitrary large number |
| `MAX + 1` overflows | `MAX == u32::MAX` | Use `checked_add` or test a different case |
| Order assertions flaky | Storage iteration unordered | Assert as a set, or sort by id before comparing |
| Test passes locally, fails in CI | Different feature flags | Run with the CI command and flags |
| Seeded records leak between tests | Shared env | Each test calls `setup()` for a fresh `Env` |

## 11. Documentation Rules

Update docs **only** to reflect behavior that already exists.

- Error contract exists but isn't documented → add one line to the function doc comment and the README naming the error and the max.
- Clamp exists but isn't documented → document it, and tell the team the behavior is now stated.
- No bound exists → **change no docs.** Report the finding (Section 2.2).

Suggested doc comment, if the behavior already exists:

```rust
/// Returns up to `limit` attestations for `subject`, starting at `start`.
///
/// # Errors
/// * `Error::InvalidPageSize` if `limit == 0` or `limit > MAX_PAGE_SIZE`.
///
/// `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` is <value>. Callers needing more records should page.
pub fn <list_fn>(...)
```

## 12. PR Description Template

```markdown
## Summary
Adds a negative test for an invalid pagination size on `<list_fn>`, plus a
regression test for a normal page size.

## What I checked
- Pagination entrypoint: `<list_fn>(subject, start, limit)`
- Published maximum: `MAX_PAGE_SIZE = <n>` in `<file>` (also documented in <README/none>)
- Current behavior: <rejects with Error::InvalidPageSize | clamps to MAX>

## Tests added
- `pagination_rejects_over_limit_page_size`: `MAX_PAGE_SIZE + 1` → `Error::InvalidPageSize`
- `pagination_normal_page_size_returns_expected_records`: limit 3 of 5 → 3 records, correct order
- `pagination_exact_max_page_size_succeeds`: boundary still accepted

## Not changed
- No new limit, constant, or error variant was added.
- Contract interface and README unchanged.

## Verification
- `cargo test -p <crate> pagination` → all pass
- Mutation check: loosening the guard by one makes the negative test fail
- `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt --check` clean
```

If a finding was reported instead:

```markdown
## Summary
No test added. `<list_fn>` has no page-size bound (see finding below).
Per task criteria, no limit was added without interface review.

## Finding
<paste Section 2.2 text>
```

## 13. Acceptance Checklist

**Explicit and bounded**
- [ ] One invalid size (zero or over-limit) is covered by a test.
- [ ] The test asserts a stable error variant **or** the documented clamp length.
- [ ] The boundary value comes from the contract constant, not a literal.
- [ ] The result is demonstrably bounded (`len <= MAX` or rejected before iteration).

**Normal behavior preserved**
- [ ] A normal page size returns the expected records, in order.
- [ ] The exact-max size still succeeds.
- [ ] The second page continues without overlap.

**Contract discipline**

- [ ] No new limit or constant added without checking the interface.
- [ ] No signature, error code number, or event changed.
- [ ] Docs updated only if the behavior already existed.
- [ ] If no bound existed, a finding was filed instead of a test.

**Process**
- [ ] Attestation pagination tests run and pass.
- [ ] Full attestation suite passes.
- [ ] Mutation check proves the test can fail.
- [ ] `clippy` and `fmt` clean.

## 14. Decision Summary

```
Inspect function and constants
        │
        ├── Bound exists, returns error ──► test MAX+1 (or 0), assert exact Error
        │
        ├── Bound exists, clamps ─────────► test MAX+1, assert len == MAX
        │
        └── No bound ─────────────────────► STOP. File finding. No test. No new limit.

Always add: normal-size regression test (+ exact-max test)
Always run: pagination tests, then the full attestation suite
Always confirm: the negative test fails when the guard is loosened
```

If you paste the pagination function, the max constant, and the existing test module's setup helpers, I'll replace every `<placeholder>` and give you the final test code as-is.
